"""
Release a target disk from every holder before destructive partitioning.

A disk freshly formatted with an external tool (GParted) is usually still held by
the running session: the desktop auto-mounts the new partitions (udisks), swap may
be active and LUKS/LVM/md mappers may sit on top. ``wipefs`` then fails with EBUSY.
This module enumerates those holders and tears them down.

Omnis runs both from a live ISO and as an AppImage on an already-installed system,
so the disk carrying the *running* system is detected by its mountpoints rather
than by assuming a live medium.
